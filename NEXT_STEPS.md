# Tier-1 — follow-up status

Deep dataset: dissipative N<=17, unitary N<=21 (Tier 1a/1c); Tier 1d pair graph
diss N<=9 pbc. Reports R1/R2/R5/R6/R7 regenerated; full suite 197 tests pass.

## Done
1. **R5 prose refreshed to the deep dataset.** Exact algebraic bases now
   94 (pbc) / 123 (obc0); growth-class tallies updated (pbc #att
   146/82/8/4, D_max 109/66/45/20; obc0 #att 162/56/22/0). The parity paragraph
   is rewritten as the calibrated period split (p in {2,3,4}, BIC margin >=10 or
   exact recurrence per class, null-calibrated: 3% vs 21%/33% for the naive
   rules, 0/4000 for the recurrence route): 33 pbc parity + 14 period-3 splits
   (14/14 obc0), of which 12 pbc / 10 obc0 period-3 splits are exact-recurrence
   certified (not fitting artifacts). Algebraic-bases table updated with the new
   named constants (2cos(pi/8), sqrt((3+sqrt17)/2), 2^{1/3}, sqrt2, ...).
2. **`tab_diss_scaling` margin fixed.** Smaller font (footnotesize + tighter
   colsep), the redundant constant *names* dropped from the growth cells (base
   number kept; names live in the algebraic-bases table), and wrapped in
   `\resizebox{\textwidth}` as a guaranteed fit. (The remaining overfull boxes
   in R5 are pre-existing unbreakable `\texttt{python -m ...}` command lines and
   the 12-rule wall-core set, unrelated to this table.)
5. **`fig_transient_depth_{pbc,obc0}` verified present** (referenced by R5).

## Held (per user, 2026-07-24)
3. **Mark W19/W55 as capped at N=16** so a future sweep does not retry N=17.
   HELD: user will launch a future sweep on a more powerful machine.
4. **Coherent-attractor count non-monotonicity + census beyond N=8.** HELD.
   (Partial progress in Tier 1d: coherence *support* persists at every N incl.
   odd, ~170/240; exact within-sector count 104/76/58 at N=4/5/6. The dense
   even-N census upturn at N=8 is a distinct quantity out of exact reach.)
